    <section id="privacy-policy" class="container">
Our company, Uvents, is an LLC, founded in 2014 by Sharang Ranjan and a web application company, Zerobyone. The service offered by our company is a free app, downloadable by IOS and Android users. The app offers an interactive platform where students can log into the app, create events, view events on and off campus and be able to view friendâ€™s activity too. The opportunity in front of us lies in the untapped market for a massive amount of potential users, with over 60,000 students at Arizona State University.
As currently stands, people see booths outside the Memorial Union and thus find out about a certain cause, but only because they happened to walk by at that particular time. If that person's daily schedule did not bring them by that location at that certain time, they would not have heard about this cause, and the hosting party would not have been able to achieve their goals. It is this discrepancy that we seek to address by introducing our mobile application, as it would solve the communication gap that currently exists.
 
Our major competitor is Facebook, the social networking website where people create events and invite their Facebook friends to those events. The second major competitor is OrgSync, an online-web management system that connects students with organizations.
The revenue model is based on a subscription model, where student clubs on campus such as SCMA, DISC or business fraternities like Alpha Kappa Psi will use our app to promote events and act as moderators for their club profile on our app. Lastly, major off campus organizations, restaurants, event planners and other parties can advertise on our app in order to reach college student.
The primary costs of our organization revolve around the hiring of personnel and the development of our app. In our initial stages we will have considerable costs to hire software developers to design and create the application based on our UI ideas. Our plan is to make all the events on campus accessible to everyone on campus anytime, anywhere and anyhow.
The app is all set to release the beta version on Julyth, 2015. If we get the funding from Innovation Challenge, we will use that funding for getting server storage space for four database, re-designing of our logo, seeking legal help for our startup and managing the daily operations of the business.
